# Deepfake music detection
This is a project for the Foundations of Data Science course made by Lorenzo Ugolini, Antonio Cordeiro, Matteo Sorrentini and Emidio Grillo.

Here is a brief description of the files you can find in this repository:
- *dataset_setup.ipynb* and *dataLoader.ipynb* contain the code used for the sampling and creation of the dataset, along with the dataloader definition;
- *histograms_analysis.ipynb* contains all the work on hisograms and their features computed from the spectrogram images of every audio track in the dataset;
- *cnn_image_classification.ipynb* and *resnet_image_classification.ipynb* contain the code used during image classification of spectrograms wtih our custom CNN model and ResNet18 respectively;
- *report.pdf* is the final submitted report.

The code was made in order to run on Google Colab and the dataset can be accessed from this Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kmGsvM3zYbxnZqxMxZuNyRd1awdT01Ui?usp=sharing.
